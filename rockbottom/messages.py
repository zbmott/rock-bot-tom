Welcome to <Rock Bottom>'s Discord server. I'm Tom, I help out around here! To keep things running smoothly, we ask that you **set your Discord nickname to match your in-game character name**. I'm happy to do that for you if you **tell me what your name is**.

Welcome to the guild! We're excited for you to be here! Let me give you a quick orientation to the way things work.

We have two raid teams: the **weekend** team raids from 6-9pm ST on Sunday and Monday, while the **weekday** team raids from 6-9pm ST on Tuesday and Wednesday. You can find raid signups under the `Raid Signups (10)` and `Raid Signups (25)` channel categories.

The guild bank is open to all guild members -- if you see something you want or need, please make a request in `#üè¶ÔΩúguild-bank` and an officer will fulfill it for you.

If you're interested in organizing events, ask an officer for the `Event Planner` role so that you can talk to `@raid-helper`.

Finally, please be sure to read `‚úÖÔΩúguild-information` for additional guild rules and policies. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to an officer.

Thanks for expressing interest in organizing guild events. Now that you're an `Event Planner`, you can interact with `@raid-helper` and manage channels under the `Raid Signups (10)` and `Raid Signups (25)` categories.

Use `/create` to start the event creation dialogue. Sometimes it's easier to `/copy` an existing event and then `/edit` the date and time. You can find complete documentation at `https://raid-helper.com/commands/`. Feel free to reach out to an `Officer` or `Adruit` if you have questions.

Congratulations on your promotion to Raid Officer! Raid officers have access to all the tabs of the guild bank. Please use this privilege responsibly in support of your raid team.

Welcome to the inner circle. Now that you're an `Officer`, you have access to the `#üëÆÔΩúofficer-chat` and `officer-lounge` channels in Discord. You also have full access to the guild bank and officer chat (`/o` or `/officer`) in-game.
