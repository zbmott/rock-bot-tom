Welcome to <CLAM LORDS>! I'm Tom, I help out around here! To keep things running smoothly, we ask that you **set your Discord nickname to match your in-game character name**. I'm happy to do that for you if you **tell me what your name is**.

Welcome to the guild! We're excited for you to be here! Let me give you a quick orientation to the way things work.

Raid signups are organized by weekday and by team name in the `Raid Zone` channel category. We have many raid teams. If you can't find one that works for you, we encourage you to organize one yourself.

If you're interested in organizing events, ask a member of the `Clam Police` for the `Event Planner` role so that you can talk to `@raid-helper`.

Finally, please be sure to read `✅｜guild-information` for additional guild rules and policies. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to a clam policeman.
    """,
    'Event Planner': """
Thanks for stepping up to organize guild events! Now that you're an `Event Planner`, you can interact with `@raid-helper` and manage channels under the `Raid Zone` channel category.
 
Use `/create` to start the event creation dialogue. Sometimes it's easier to `/copy` an existing event and then `/edit` the date and time. You can find complete documentation at `https://raid-helper.com/commands/`. Feel free to reach out to anyone with the `Clam Police` rank or `Metaslave` if you have questions.

`Event Planners` can coordinate with each other in `#🪖｜organizer-chat`. Please also check the pins in that channel to get an idea of where to put your events.

    'Clam Police': """
Welcome to the inner circle. Now that you're a member of the `Clam Police`, you have access to the `👮｜police-chat` and `🏦｜police hq` channels in Discord. You also have access to officer chat (`/o` or `/officer`) in-game.
